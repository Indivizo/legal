## <a name="introduction"></a> Introduction

At Indivizo Ltd we are devoted to respect your right to privacy and protect your personal data.

The Privacy Policy (“Policy”) together with the [General Terms and Conditions](http://www.indivizo.com/general-terms-and-conditions) and Terms of Use describe how we control the personal data provided by you getting in touch with us as a potential employer (client) or as an applicant. Please read the following information carefully so that we can give you a detailed picture about our privacy policy and the way we treat your personal data.

The website available at [www.indivizo.com](http://www.indivizo.com) or [www.indivizo.hu](http://www.indivizo.hu) (“Website”) and the application available at https://app.indivizo.com (“Application”, or “Service”) maintained by Indivizo aim to provide information and services to job seekers (“Applicants”), who are able to upload data to the Indivizo database during the registration process, able to provide further data during the application process and who can take part in video interviews. It also provides information and services to employers, who participate in and manage the recruitment process with the help of the Application. During the registration we request personal data such as name, email address, telephone number or company data such as company name, registered seat, tax number, sector (optional) and number of employees (also optional). The language preferred to be used during the recruitment process is a necessary setting for the operation of the Application. Apart from the provision of our Service we control personal and company data with the aim to use them for direct marketing purposes. Apart from the data provided by Applicants and the companies managing recruitment processes (“Client(s)”, or “Potential employer(s)” we also control personal data provided by people requesting a demo of our service or subscribing to our newsletters. ( “Applicant(s)” and “Client(s)” are commonly referred to as “User(s)”)

Based on Act CXII of 2011 on the right of informational self-determination and on freedom of information (“Privacy Act”) Data Controllers are: a) the companies that manage the recruitment processes and obtain personal data from the Applicants (i.e. our Clients) with respect to all types of service packages, b)  Indivizo in relation to all data uploaded with respect to the freemium package; c) Indivizo in relation to the data uploaded during the registration process  with respect to premium packages.

Data provided by our Clients during the registration process: company name, name, email address and phone number of the contact person, registered seat of the company, tax number, sector (optional) and number of employees (optional).

Data provided by the Applicants during the registration process: name, email address, photo.

Indivizo is considered as a data processor related to all personal data collected by our Clients, the data of Applicants recorded and stored in the Application apart from the data collected by us during the registration process (name, email address and photo) with respect to all premium packages.

The subcontractors of Indivizo indicated below are also considered as data processors.

## <a name="legal-basis"></a> Legal basis of data control

Control of the data provided electronically via our Application is based on the voluntary consent of the colleagues of our Clients having access to our Service and the voluntary consent of the Applicants (together hereinafter referred to as “Users”). In certain cases data control is based on obligations prescribed by law.

The statement of consent of minors under the age of 14 and the statement of consent of Users who are legally incapable are given by their legal representatives. Minors between the ages of 14 and 16 and Users whose legal capacity is limited are not allowed to give permission for data control without the prior consent of their legal representatives or their subsequent approval. The statement of consent of minors over the age of 16 shall be considered valid without the valid permission or subsequent approval of their legal representative. Indivizo is not able to validate the content of the statement given by the representative, and Indivizo cannot check whether the representative is legally entitled to give permission, therefore the User (or his legal representative) shall warrant that the consent given meet the requirements. If the Services of Indivizo are used it is implied that proper consent is given by the legal representative.

Any of Indivizo Services is used on a voluntary basis. Personal data is collected only if you wish to use our Service.

## <a name="cookies-and-local-storage"></a> Cookies and the use of the local storage of the browser

Without going into technical details we would like to outline the meaning of two important concepts.

A cookie is a small piece of data sent from a website you visit and stored in your web browser. Every time you visit the website again, the browser sends the cookie back to the server. This is the way most websites are informed that you are logged in. For more details we recommend this Wikipedia article.

The local storage, although its aims is similar to that of the cookies, is a bit more modern tool to store the necessary information for the operation of a website in your browser. An important difference is that your browser does not send the data stored in the local storage to the server of the website you are using, but an application of the website running in your browser has access to the data. For more details we recommend [this Wikipedia article](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_storage).

For analytical purposes our Website and Application (with the help of our data processors) use cookies, which help to analyze users’ web browsing habits. For more information on our data processing partners see [the chapter of Data Processing](#data-processing).

If you decide to do so, you might not be able to reach all the functions of our Application or Website.

Our Application uses the local storage technology to identify you and to speed up the operation of the Application. For example your levels of access, the list of recruitment processes related to you, your name, your photo, certain settings of yours (etc.) are stored in the local storage in order so that they can be accessed by the Application as quickly as possible. This batch of information (except for your name and photo) does not contain data that can be processed by third parties, for example the recruitment processes are stored without their names.

Please do not share your password with anyone. Passwords are secured with one of the most modern algorithms.
